          <h2>Current Status</h2>

          <p>Available for contracting in Manchester, UK, or remote.</p>
          <p>
            I have years of experience with Typescript, Javascript, Elm, Python &amp; C++. I have a
            strong interest in functional programming languages and a growing knowledge of Elixir
            &amp; Rust.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am enthusiastic about team organisation, structuring meetings, group culture, 1-on-1s
            and retrospectives.
          </p>

          <h2>Bio</h2>

          <p>
            I am the lead developer on a Python/Django community focussed website providing a
            calendaring solution for dance teachers and event organisers. The site runs on Linode
            with Apache, Postgresql, Python, &amp; Django for the backend and Javascript, jQuery,
            React.js &amp; bacon.js for the front end. Selenium is used for testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have worked with Python and C++ for 8 years creating graphics applications and tools
            for artists in the film industry. Additionally I have written pipeline programs to
            improve the workflow and efficiency of the companies I have worked at.
          </p>

          <p>
            My last role included planning and designing a new tool and carrying out the
            implementation whilst managing the project and a team of 3 developers. I enjoy working
            in teams and working with the strengths and preferences of my colleagues.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a keen advocate of the git revision control system and became the point person for
            the transition to git in my department at Weta Digital. I am also actively involved in
            open source work on Github with two successful projects, and many other ones, which I
            maintain and support for the users.

          <p>
            An extension to reStructuredText and Sphinx which is able to read and format the

          <h3>Minor</h3>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/michaeljones/porter">Porter</a></h4>
          <p>A map-based import hook for Python.</p>
          <p>
            Supports encoding the module name and its location into a PYTHONPATH-like environment
            variable which is parsed at runtime and used for faster imports. Aimed at avoiding the
            standard Python linear search through the PYTHONPATH to find a module which can be slow
            for large numbers of entries over a network.

            Enables a documentation strategy in which the maintainers of a project can publish a
            Python module with up to date links for documentation based on keywords. Other projects
            wanting to link to the appropriate documentation only need to use the keywords and
            latest published module to stay up to date.

          <p>
            Aims to reduce code duplication between the two associated functions by abstracting down
            to a single set of calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provides inheritance based approach as well as experimental basic template
