Video Round Up
==============

I've watched a few videos and listened to a few podcasts recently which deserve
a mention but which I failed to integrate into the journal entries. Mostly from
the functionaltalks.org_ site.

`Running a Startup on Haskell`_ - Brian O'Sullivan

   An entertaining and quite casual talk taking an overview of the decisions
   made in using Haskell for a startup. Not technical, I didn't have the slides
   up and didn't feel like I missed anything.

`Superhero monads`_ - Katie Miller

   A look into Monads with attempts to illustrate their structure and use in
   particular situations, mostly the ``Maybe`` and ``List`` monads. Includes
   reference code in Haskell and Java.

   It is interesting to see the Java implementations both for how much more
   succinct the Haskell code is but also simply to show that it is possible to
   use the idea of monads in other languages and to get a feel for what that
   looks like.

   A good talk which happily provides another reference for learning monads and their potential.

`Roy: rescuing JavaScript from itself`_ - Brian McKenna

   A short but interesting talk of a function language which compiles down to
   Javascript and attempts to tackle some of the short comings in the target
   language.

   An impressive collection of features insprired by functional languages.

`Functional Reactive Programming`_ - Wilkes Joiner

   A short introduction to FRP which doesn't necessarily have the time to do it
   justice but is still an interesting watch. I've little experience with GUIs
   and the kinds of event driven problems that the presenter demostrates solving
   but the he makes a good case for the advertised approach being simple,
   understandable and a great deal clearer that nested callbacks.

   I've no idea how it compares to other solutions to "callback hell" but it
   seems to be backed by a number of big players.

`Simon Marlow on Parallelism and Concurrency`_ - Haskell Cast

   Podcast with Simon Marlow; covering his move to Facebook and his work on the
   free book on Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell.
