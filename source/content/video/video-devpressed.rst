An excellent talk about going through and dealing with mental illness in the
form of Type II Bipolar and ADHD. I don't feel that I have had to deal with
these issues myself nor am I aware of any close friends going through it but I
am guilty of not understanding it well. Greg Baugues opens up the door a little
to allow me begin to see and understand what it might be to deal with these
conditions.

He has given the talk a number of times as detailed and linked to on his
`speaking page`_.
