An `OSCON 2007 talk
<http://blip.tv/oreilly-open-source-convention/oscon-2007-simon-peyton-jones-a-taste-of-haskell-part-i-329701>`_
introducing Haskell to imperative programmers by Simon Peyton Jones.

I like his pacing and attitude and I think there is a reasonable amount to be
learnt despite the fact that the slides are not provided on the site or
displayed in the video. I am sure they can be tracked down.

I can't tell at the moment how much I understood purely from the quality of the
talk and how much from the previous efforts I've made to get to grips with
Haskell.
