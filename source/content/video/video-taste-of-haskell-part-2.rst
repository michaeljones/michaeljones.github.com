Video: Taste of Haskell - Part 2
================================

Second half of the Simon Peyton-Jones' introduction to Haskell. If I was not
convinced before, I am now; this is a really excellent talk to give you some
background to Haskell and some pleasantly gentle steps towards understanding it.

Provides examples of pure functions and combining them with code that needs to
do the IO before going on to discuss the wider Haskell community.

I really love his presentation manner. It is quite disarming.
