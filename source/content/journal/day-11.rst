Results
-------

* Read through the chapter of Learn You a Haskell. This is the first chapter
  where I'm beginning to feel unsure of how solid my understanding has been so
  far. It all just about holds together but I'm aware of how little practical
  application I've attempted with the knowledge so far.

* Found a new `Haskell tutorial`_.

* Refactored use of ``eval`` in the RigControls_ project to use a dictorionary
  based factory instead.
