* I have managed to get this `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_ based blog
  up. I choose Pelican because a simple google unearthed `this
  <http://pydanny.com/choosing-a-new-python-based-blog-engine.html>`_ from
  pydanny with a comment from Kenneth Reitz and that is enough of an endorsement
  for me.  

  Plus I like rst.

  Things, like URLs, might chop and change for a bit whilst I figure this out.

* Done the first 7 of the 99 Haskell Problems with a combination of half
  forgotten memories and referring to `Learn You a Haskell
  <http://learnyouahaskell.com/>`_. My efforts are stumbling and awkward and
  nothing works first time.

* I watched `Simon Peyton-Jones - A Taste of Haskell Part I
  <{filename}/video/video-taste-of-haskell-part-1.rst>`_.
