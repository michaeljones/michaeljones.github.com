Journal - Day 24
================

:date: 2013-12-03

Intentions
----------

* Read chapter 8 of Real World Haskell.

* Refactor ``jump`` program source code to introduce modules.

Results
-------

* Read half of chapter 8.

* Refactored source code to split separate concerns into modules. This reduces
  the import clutter at the top of the ``Main.hs`` and makes things a little
  more manageable.
