Weekend
-------

* Worked through chapter 5 and half of chapter 6 of Learn You a Haskell.

* Installed ghc-7.6.3 and haskell-platform-2013.2.0.0 using these_ instructions
  as Ubuntu seems to have made some potentially odd choices for the version of
  ghc they shipped on 13.04 so there isn't a packaged haskell-platform available
  for it.

* Began to look at cppreference.com_ to see if there is anything I could
  contribution to the community driven project.

* Downloaded 0ad_ from Ubuntu repositories with the intention of checking it out
  as an open source game.

Week in Review
--------------

I had such grand plans moving into this period of personal work. This first week
has been an education in the realities of it all. Mostly:

* It is lonely to work from home all day. I am not an enormously social creature
  but I certainly miss having colleagues around.

* Learning Haskell takes a long time. Coming from imperative programming
  languages, it feels like starting again. This is what people say so it
  should not have been surprising but I guess I'm not used to feeling
  unproductive in a programming environment. 

  That said, this is the third time I've tried to read through Haskell tutorials
  and work through some issues and it is beginning to feel a little more
  familiar, a little less alien. Completing basic tasks in the pure functional
  side of things is new feeling easy which is a start. IO and more complex
  programs still await.

* As mentioned previously_, the guide I have followed for learning Haskell this
  week included more complex problems focussed on simple parts of the language
  than I feel I would like. I would rather be learning more about the language
  on simpler problems. I feel that if I'm trying to learn a language but
  spending significant time trying to understand the actual problem rather than
  its solution then I am focussing on the wrongs things.

* It is rewarding to engage with people on open source projects. It is fair to
  expect certain amount of effort on this part as well. Supporting open source
  projects is not customer service as much as guide collaboration.

Wishlist
--------

* More simple problems to tackle in Haskell. I think this is potentially
  difficult without introducing IO, but I would argue that it might make sense
  to introduce some very basic, even unexplained, IO in order to be able to
  tackle some more problems with the rest of the language.

* I find myself wanting a Haskell style guide. It is hard to know, as a
  beginner, when to use ``where`` vs ``let .. in``, when to declare another
  independent function vs using ``where``, etc., and how many function calls can
  be put in a row before it is deemed unreadable and other mechanisms, like local
  bindings, should be introduced to improve readability.

* More talks on basic Haskell and introductions to the language. Simon
  Peyton-Jones' talks were great but initial googling is no uncovering any more.
