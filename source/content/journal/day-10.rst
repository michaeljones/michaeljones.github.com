Intentions
----------

* Read through chapter 12 of Learn You a Haskell. Starting on the big scary
  "monads"

* Grab the 0ad source code from github_.

* Investigate the issue_ reported on the Breathe mailing list.

.. _github: https://github.com/0ad/0ad
.. _issue: http://librelist.com/browser//breathe/2013/10/17/doxygenclass-+-members-fails/

Results
-------

* Finished chapter 12. Monads do not seem very scary when explained well. Of
  course, I might not have understood them at all.

* I grabbed the 0ad source code. The git repository is over a gigabyte of data.
  It is vaguely alarming. I haven't tried to complite it yet but spent a little
  time scanning over the directories to get a feel for the complexity. It is
  impressively larger than anything I've dealt with before.

* Managed to get a fix out for the reported issue in Breathe will a little back
  and forth.

* Watch a `Google TechTalk`_ on Haskell. A brief introduction by mzero_ which is
  really quite a whirlwind tour. I don't think I would recommend it as an
  introduction but it settled in very nicely to the stage of learning I'm at as
  a quick reinforcement of ideas that I have seen so far.

  I think the time required to properly explain the various common abstractions
  in Haskell makes it enormously hard to do a deep and meaningful
  no-prior-knowledge-required talk about the language.
