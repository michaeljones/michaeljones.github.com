Intentions
----------

* Continue working on vty-ui example to at least emulate the functionality of my
  jump_ helper script.

* Set up basic testsuite for the RigControls_ project.

* Improve & update information on michaeljones.github.io.

* Grab the source code for IHaskell_.

.. _jump: https://github.com/michaeljones/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/jump
.. _RigControls: https://github.com/Everzen/RigControls

Results
-------

* More work on the Jump project including starting to look at the yaml_ package
  for reading my jump config file. As a beginner, I am finding it a struggle to
  start with new packages when they don't have a tutorial section. The tests
  only get you so far. A simple start guide would not go amiss.
  
  Perhaps this will improve with experience. Perhaps Haskell APIs have a
  structure which I am not familiar enough with yet.

* Installed nose2_ to the RigControls_ virtualenv I have and wrote a trivial
  test to test that it was working.

  Required getting PyQt4 working in the virtualenv which, for me, involved
  directly copying the system installed packages as recommended in this
  stackoverflow response_.

* Investigated Unicode best practices in response to a sphinx-to-github ticket_.

* Updated my development copy of michaeljones.github.io to include more
  information for potential future employers. To act as more of a CV.

* Did not grab the souce code for IHaskell_. Might give up on that one for the
  moment.
