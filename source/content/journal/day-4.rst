Intentions
----------

* Work through the **#31** to **#41** Haskell problems.
* Read first 6 chapters of Learn You a Haskell for Great Good.
* Fix issue reported in the Breathe quick-start documentation.
* Look into curses development in Haskell.

Results
-------

* I spent a long time looking at Haskell problem **#27** and then went on to
  other things. I think it is an interesting problem and I should be able to do
  it, however it is beginning to frustrate me for other reasons.

  The issue is my approach: I'm treating this list of problems as a good
  introduction to Haskell but it isn't really. It is a set of interesting
  problems of growing difficulty which can be solved with Haskell if you want.
  The issue is that they aren't designed to introduce you to different parts of
  the language and in particular they start asking complex problems which simple
  parts of the language instead of simple problems with increasingly complex
  parts of the language. I'm not learning Haskell here; I'm learning parts of
  mathematics instead. An excellent destination but not where I'm going.

  The `stackoverflow post <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1016986>`_ which suggests
  these problems alse suggests the `Project Euler <http://projecteuler.net/>`_
  problems another source to work through but they suffer from exactly the same
  issues.

  Perhaps the average person interested in Haskell has a mathematical background
  and so these problems, which really aren't that hard, are more bread and
  butter to them. For me, I'm going to have to find another path. Perhaps
  focussing on Learn You a Haskell and then trying to replace some of my
  various workflow helper scripts with Haskell versions as a test.

* Ironically, I did not get around to reading the Learn You a Haskell chapters.
* I could not reproduce the issue with the Breathe quickstart documentation,
  though more investigation might uncover it.
* I did not look into curses development.

I did go to the gym, tour the New Zealand parliament, have a singing lesson and
have drinks with friends. Some days have other ideas than coding.
