Intentions
----------

* Review work on Breathe_ from yesterday, merge results into master.

* Review first chapter of `Real World Haskell`_ and read the next.

Results
-------

* Merged Breathe_ changes with a few additional clean ups into master and
  pushed.

* Read first and second chapter of `Real World Haskell`_ and some of chapter 3.

* Watched `Code Rush`_ documentary on Youtube. An interesting slice of history
  though I found it some what of a tease to the lack of detail on the technical
  side which left me with questions but it has an understandable focus for its
  intended audience and subject.

* Came across `Hello Processing`_ which looks pretty cool as an introduction to
  programming or at least I enjoyed the presentation of the first section.
