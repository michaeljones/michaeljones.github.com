Intentions
----------

* Read `cabal sandbox post`_ and set up a sandbox area for my Haskell dev
  project. Cabal sandboxes are meant to mimic the Python virtualenv
  functionality.

* Take a closer look at the RigControls_ project and try to improve the curve
  performance.

.. _cabal sandbox post: http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2013-08-20-Cabal-sandbox.html

Results
-------

* Read the cabal sandbox post and set up a basic sandbox area.

* Talked through some changes to the RigControls_ project with my brother.
  Conferring on coding style and some subtleties of Python.

* `Improved curve performance`_ in RigControls_ by switching to a recalculate on
  demand rather than recalculate on change strategy.

* Read the first page of the `Learn Haskell Hard & Fast`_ tutorial. In
  comparison to LYAH, it feels like it is going at a lightning pace and lacks
  the thoroughness required, however it might round out in future sections. It
  is certainly tempting to try to write a Haskell tutorial which explicitly
  skips over particular details early on in order to get to more practical
  examples. It will be interesting to see if this tutorial takes that approach.
