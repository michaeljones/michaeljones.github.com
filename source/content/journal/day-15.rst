Journal - Day 15
================

:date: 2013-10-25
:category: journal

Intentions
----------

* Continue my quest to parse Yaml in Haskell. Or rather, use the data returned
  from the Yaml parser library I'm using (yaml_.)

* Try to write at least one test for RigControls_.

Results
-------

* Continued exploration of the Yaml library but without much success. Determined
  that perhaps it would be productive to journal my failings and hopefully
  eventual success at using this library. Sadly this decision came after a
  little progress so I will have to try to reproduce those first steps in an
  appropriately clueless way.

* Failed to write any tests. Dammit.

.. _RigControls: http://github.com/EverZen/RigControls
.. _yaml: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml-0.8.5
