Intentions
----------

* Finish chapter 8 and read chapter 9 of Learn You a Haskell.

* Figure out how to do something basic with the Yaml library.

* Finish work on image support in Breathe.

Results
-------

* Finished chapter 8 and read half of chapter 9. They are really long chapter, I
  swear.

* I did not yet figure out some basics with Yaml library but editing one of the
  examples given in LYAH allowed me to feel a little more confident about my
  progress with the language.

* Finished up the image support and closed the ticket. The user has further use
  cases but admits that they are non-standard.

* Also played a little bit of 0ad and looked through the contribution pages. I
  have no idea why they are still on svn but they do at least have a github
  mirror_. I got beaten pretty hard by the AI and did a panic-quit rather than
  watch my town go down in flames.

* Watched a discussion_ on D & Haskell and their development and ecosystems.
