Intentions
----------

* Continue with Yaml library example and article.

Results
-------

* Finished Yaml library example and article though rapidly learnt how foolishly
  simple it was after further examination of the yaml_ module. The ``FromJSON``
  functionality exposed by it is really rather fantastic.

* Listened to `Haskell Cast 3`_ with Simon Peyton Jones. Parts are over my head,
  but most is interesting and well layed out for the average programmer
  listener.

  Includes some fascinating information about improving the national curriculum
  in the UK to include computer science education from a young age. My school
  experience included :abbr:`ICT <Information Communcations Techology>` which
  really just meant basic use of Word, Excel and Access. Not completely basic
  but very much end user level rather than understanding the machine and how to
  program it.
