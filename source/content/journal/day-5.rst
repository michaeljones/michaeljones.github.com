===============

:date: 2013-10-11

Intentions
----------

* Read first 6 chapters of Learn You a Haskell for Great Good.
* Further investigate quickstart issue for Breathe.

Results
-------

* Read the first 4 chapters of Learn You a Haskell.
* Pushed a fix for a possible KeyError in the project handling code for Breathe.
* Took a cursory look at contributing to the Libre Office project. Their
  developers_ page is the place to start with their `easy hacks`_ page being an
  early target, I imagine. I have no particular love for the Libre Office project,
  but a great deal of respect as I have used it often.
