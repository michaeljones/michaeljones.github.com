I am embarking on some time for some personal projects and this blog is designed
to mark my progress and keep on track. I am currently far from clear about what
to work on but I have a few loose ideas:

* Experiment with the `Rust <http://www.rust-lang.org/>`_ language and get a
  feel for how to compares with C++. 

  I am keen to pursue Rust as I have a reasonable and growing amount of
  experience with C++ and would love to see a replacement with equal power but
  less cruft.

* Explore `Clojure <http://clojure.org/>`_ as a lisp and a language on the JVM.

  I have been watching some of Rich Hickey's Greatest Hits and still yearn for
  that moment of enlightenment which legend suggests is brought on by
  understanding lisp.

* Become familiar with Haskell and work through the `99 Haskell problems
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems>`_.

  More and more the functional approaches to coding intrigue me and feel like
  the correct way forward. What can be more functional than Haskell?

* Continue to support `Breathe <https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe>`_.

  My Sphinx-Doxygen bridge project which has a small community of users and a
  low but steady stream of requests.

* Push forward with development on build and environment system prototype built
  on `Ninja <martine.github.io/ninja>`_ and inspired by `Rez
  <https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez>`_.

  A prototype built at my last place of work seemed to have curious potential to
  it. I'd like to push it to the point where it succeeds or breaks.

* Explore programming with audio.

  I have a few musical outlets in my life and I find myself increasingly
  interested in how it is represented in data and how malleable it might be in
  that form.

* Help with my brother's `Rig Controls
  <https://github.com/Everzen/RigControls>`_ project.

  It has promise and a family connection. 

* Improve my knowledge of Open GL & SDL.

  I have been in graphics for too long without getting to grips with either.
