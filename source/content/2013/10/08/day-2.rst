Intentions
----------

* Continue 99 Haskell Problems and reach no. 20.
* Chase up support tickets #65 & #66 on Breathe.

Results
-------

* Reached problem no. 17. Definitely learning a bit more about haskell whilst
  still only juggling lists in various ways. I would kill for some easily
  approachable code that did some real work but all in good time.
* Ticket #66 remains inactive.
* Ticket #65 resulted in more work than anticipated as the problem is
  non-standard. Potential for interesting work for fixing it but it took a while
  to get back into the Breathe set up which I have neglected for a while.

  Getting to play around with virtualenv a little more though which is something
  I've been late in picking up.
