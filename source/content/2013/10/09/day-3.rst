Intentions
----------

* Continue **99 Haskell Problems** and reach #25.
* Finish up work for Breathe ticket **#65**.
* Listen to **A Taste of Haskell - Part 2**.

Results
-------

* Reached Haskell Problem #26 but only by skipping the ones involving random
  numbers which I did at the recommendations of this post.
* Finished up **#65** on Breathe which turned out to be easier than expected. I
  still do not understand the constructors for the docutils node classes.
* Watched the second part of `A Taste of Haskell
  <{filename}video-taste-of-haskell-part-2.rst>`_
* Also watched an `introductory talk <{filename}video-rust.rst>`_ on Rust.

Todo
----

* Email docutils list for explanation of constructors.
* Extend folder navigation script to source python virtualenv where desirable.
