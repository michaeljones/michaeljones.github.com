</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This is an attempt to share the my initial discoveries on how to set up a
Haskell project. My plan was to create a small project for an executable written
in Haskell and I didn't have the first idea where to start.</p>
<p>I am new to the language and the ecosystem and this article wanders through my
discovery process. Skip straight to the <a class="reference internal" href="#review">review</a> for a summary.</p>
<div class="section" id="note">
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>This is well covered in the Haskell Wiki on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program">How to write a Haskell program</a>. I
had not found that guide at the time of working through this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="working-on-ubuntu-13-04">
<h2>Working on Ubuntu 13.04</h2>
<p>Following some best practices advice, I wanted to get the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a> to
act as a starting point for development. However for reasons that I do not fully
understand, Ubuntu 13.04 does not have a version of the Haskell platform (it
seems to be related to the version of ghc they decided to ship with.)</p>
<p>Follow <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/a/316465">these</a> instructions will get you a working copy of the Haskell Platform
along with the appropriate version of ghc. It takes a while to compile though!
I've installed these into the following directories:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$TOOLS/apps/ghc/ghc-7.6.3
$TOOLS/apps/haskell-platform/haskell-platform-2013.2.0.0
</pre>
<p>For some value of <tt class="docutils literal">$TOOLS</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-libraries">
<h2>Getting Libraries</h2>
<p>With that going and in my environment, I made a new project directory for my
<tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> program:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ mkdir $WORK/jump
</pre>
<p>My project is going to need a terminal interface and some googling comes up with
<a class="reference external" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty">vty</a> which appears to be some kind of ncurses equivalent for Haskell. So I try:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cabal install vty
</pre>
<p>Which tells me to run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cabal update
</pre>
<p>Which tells me that there is a new cabal-install package available that I should
update to. I initially install this to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$TOOLS/apps/haskell-packages/cabal-1.18.0.2
</pre>
<p>Using:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cabal install --prefix=$TOOLS/apps/haskell-packages/cabal-1.18.0.2 cabal-install
</pre>
<p>As I really like subfoldering things but this soon looks like it'll be too
awkward to manage in my immature set up as each package has its own libraries
and executables which means a lot of paths to figure out unless they are all
grouped together.</p>
<p>So I install it straight to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$TOOLS/apps/haskell-packages
</pre>
<p>This seems to work though the central install location bothers me in the same
way that any centralised collection of dependencies would. Something is going to
conflict at some point. What I really want is some kind of equivalent to
Python's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ahhh-sandboxes">
<h2>Ahhh Sandboxes</h2>
<p>Some googling thankfully finds cabal sandboxes which are very much what I am
looking forward. <a class="reference external" href="http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2013-08-20-Cabal-sandbox.html">This page</a> is particularly helpful.</p>
<p>So I follow the instructions and run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd $WORK/jump
$ cabal sandbox init
</pre>
<p>This seems promising. A <tt class="docutils literal">cabal install vty</tt> now installs into this local
sandbox set up and I don't have to worry about shared collections of
dependencies anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compiling">
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>Great, I'm ready to start coding. I make a a trivial <tt class="docutils literal">Main.hs</tt> file which
pulls in a <a class="reference external" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty-ui">vty-ui</a> module (it turns out the <tt class="docutils literal">vty</tt> is pretty low level and
vty-ui provide more friendly widgets for building interfaces.)</p>
<p>So let's compile:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ghc --make Main.hs
</pre>
<p>I haven't read up on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--make</span></tt> flag but it seems like the thing to do.
Anyway, this doesn't work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Main.hs:2:8:
    Could not find module `Graphics.Vty.Widgets.All'
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
</pre>
<p>No trouble, I've played around with toy <tt class="docutils literal">ghc</tt> compiles before. I believe there
is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-package</span></tt> flag to provide paths to packages. Cool. Where is the package?
I run <tt class="docutils literal">find</tt> in the sandbox and get a lot of paths like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./.cabal-sandbox/lib/x86_64-linux-ghc-7.6.3/vty-ui-1.6/Graphics/Vty/Widgets/All.hi
</pre>
<p>My <span class="strike">spidey</span> programmer sense is tingling; I've not compiled much in
Haskell but that doesn't look like something to add to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-package</span></tt> flag. Too
much specific data in there. Just a hunch but I start looking around for
alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cabal-build">
<h2>Cabal Build</h2>
<p>I couldn't see much else to help with <tt class="docutils literal">ghc</tt> and it seemed that we were
pretty neck deep in this sandbox so on reviewing the <a class="reference external" href="http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2013-08-20-Cabal-sandbox.html">sandbox guide</a> from
earlier I saw the use of:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cabal build
</pre>
<p>Worth a crack, right? Well, yes, but this was the response:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Package has never been configured. Configuring with default flags. If this
fails, please run configure manually.
cabal: No cabal file found.
Please create a package description file &lt;pkgname&gt;.cabal
</pre>
<p>Ok, we need some kind of configuration file. No idea what goes in it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ touch jump.cabal
$ cabal build
</pre>
<p>Progress:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Package has never been configured. Configuring with default flags. If this
fails, please run configure manually.
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Using 'build-type: Custom' but there is no Setup.hs or Setup.lhs
script.
</pre>
<p>Ok, lets have a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty">vty project</a> on Github and see what they are
doing. They've got some kind of <tt class="docutils literal">Setup.lhs</tt> file with this in it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell
&gt; import Distribution.Simple
&gt; main = defaultMain
</pre>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml">yaml</a> project I've been keeping an eye on has something similar. Ok:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cat &lt;&lt; ENDCAT &gt; Test.lhs
#!/usr/bin/env runhaskell
&gt; import Distribution.Simple
&gt; main = defaultMain
ENDCAT
$ cabal build
</pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Package has never been configured. Configuring with default flags. If this
fails, please run configure manually.
Resolving dependencies...
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Setup.lhs, dist/setup/Main.o )
Linking ./dist/setup/setup ...
Configuring ...
setup: No 'name' field.

No 'version' field.

No executables and no library found. Nothing to do.
</pre>
<p>Ok. Expecting some kind of <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">version</tt> fields. This is starting to
seem like progress so I look at the vty project <tt class="docutils literal">vty.cabal</tt> file and we see a
simple key value set up:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
name:    jump
version: 0.0.0
</pre>
<p>Vim highlights this which is always a good sign:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cabal build
Package has never been configured. Configuring with default flags. If this
fails, please run configure manually.
Resolving dependencies...
Configuring jump-0.0.0...
setup: No executables and no library found. Nothing to do.
</pre>
<p>More cross referencing with github, this time the <a class="reference external" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml">yaml</a> project and we add:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
executable jump
    main-is: Main.hs
</pre>
<p>Now we're on to something. We've got a few more warnings but finally some
compile errors! Things are happening. Playing around shows that we need to add:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cabal-version:   &gt;= 1.2
build-type:      Simple
</pre>
<p>To silence the warnings. A guess-and-test shows that we no longer need the
<tt class="docutils literal">Setup.lhs</tt> file now that we have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build-type</span></tt> set to <tt class="docutils literal">Simple</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dependency-management">
<h2>Dependency Management</h2>
<p>So those compile errors? They are actually pretty damned cool if you ask me. The
first one sets the tone:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Main.hs:1:1:
    Could not find module `Prelude'
    It is a member of the hidden package `base'.
    Perhaps you need to add `base' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Prelude</tt> is the essentially default, built-in functionality in Haskell. All
the functions that you're going to be using all the time so they are just there.
This is included by default in programs if you do a <tt class="docutils literal">ghc</tt> invocation from the
command line or if you use <tt class="docutils literal">ghci</tt> but here we're being asked to explicitly
declare the dependency.</p>
<p>Dependencies are a nightmare if they aren't managed properly so I am in favour
of this. Additionally it allows this <tt class="docutils literal">base</tt> package to changes its contents as
it versions up and projects can declare the version range they require to
operate.</p>
<p>So the next addition is to add the build dependencies to the <tt class="docutils literal">executable</tt>
section:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
executable jump
    main-is: src/Main.hs
    build-depends: base &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; &lt; 5
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">4</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">5</tt> range is stoten from the <tt class="docutils literal">yaml</tt> project. This gets extended
in the typical prefixed comma style for further dependencies as the project
grows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
executable jump
    main-is: src/Main.hs
    build-depends: base &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; &lt; 5
                 , vty-ui == 1.6
                 , vty == 4.7.3
                 , yaml == 0.8.5.1
                 , vector == 0.10.9.1
                 , text == 0.11.3.1
</pre>
<p>Each time you need a new dependency you can <tt class="docutils literal">cabal install</tt> it into your
sandbox and then the <tt class="docutils literal">cabal build</tt> command will make sure you have it properly
specified in your <tt class="docutils literal">.cabal</tt> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-review">
<span id="review"></span><h2>In Review</h2>
<p>If I wanted an introduction to Haskell project setup, coming from a C++ &amp; Python
background, I would want something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Cabal sandboxes provide a virtualenv style enviroment for project development.
Your project root directory becomes your sandbox.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Your project <tt class="docutils literal">.cabal</tt> file acts a little like a C++ project's <tt class="docutils literal">Makefile</tt>.
It also has some flavours of a Python project's <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A simple set up thankfully only requires a simple configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Running <tt class="docutils literal">cabal build</tt> is roughly the equivalent of running <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> for a
C++ project and the cabal sandox/build set up is much easier to manage than a
Makefile with paths to all the libraries &amp; headers you require for C++. It is
more of a build system than a Makefile.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Build dependencies have to be explicitly declared or else <tt class="docutils literal">cabal build</tt>
won't compile.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Your final <tt class="docutils literal">.cabal</tt> file for a simple single file executable project will
look a little like this:</p>
