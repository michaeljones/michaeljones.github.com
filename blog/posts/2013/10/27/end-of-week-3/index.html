<h2>Weekend</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Watched <a class="reference external" href="http://yow.eventer.com/events/1004/talks/1054">Escape From the Ivory Tower</a> presentation by Simon Peyton Jones. It
is an approachable easy-listening style talk which gives the history of the
development of Haskell and the goals of the language. No prior knowledge of
the language required though, as always, it helps.</li>
<li>Wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://michaeljones.github.io/blog/posts/2013/10/27/setting-up-a-haskell-project/">blog post</a> about stumbling through a Haskell Project set up. The
content is perhaps better covered on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program">Haskell Wiki</a> though I found that too
late.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="week-in-review">
<h2>Week in Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Definitely making progress with Haskell but still nowhere near comfortable
with it. Clueless on how to begin most tasks but at least I can slowly battle
my way towards something. Work needs to continue both via exercising the
knowledge I have and also by moving on to other tutorials. <a class="reference external" href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a>
&amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/haskell-fast-hard">Learn Haskell Hard &amp; Fast</a> might be reasonable guides for this stage,
especially the former</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Improved the performance of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EverZen/RigControls">RigControls</a> and began to toy with the idea of
tests but, as with any unfamiliar codebase which isn't designed for testing,
there isn't an easy starting place. Might need more effort than first hoped.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Fixed an issue with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github">Sphinx-to-Github</a> regarding unicode handling. Gave me some
motivation to read up on unicode a little more and the best practices
surrounding it and its use in Python. Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Data is <em>decoded</em> from a particular character-set into unicode point data and
<em>encoded</em> the other way.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You have to write files with a particular encoding. You don't write unicode
point data to a file, or rather you do, but in one of any number of
character-sets. There isn't a default.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can't find out the encoding of a file unless it has a Byte Order Mark
(BOM) which tells you. In which case, you need to worry about removing that
BOM and not interpreting it as text.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ideally you should know the encoding of the files you are trying to read, if
you don't you're basicall left trying to guess. UTF-8 is a good first guess.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You should try to decode as soon as possible so that you're handling
proper unicode strings in your code rather than ASCII with potentially
invalid bytes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python 2.x attempts to read all files as ASCII by default which is the
source of some head aches with Python 2.x and unicode.</p>
<p>You can convert either by decoding the string that you have read or by
reading via <tt class="docutils literal">codecs.open</tt> which provides an option for the encoding as an
argument.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python 3.x defaults to reading files at UTF-8 by default and all standard
strings or unicode by default with the <tt class="docutils literal">bytestring</tt> type there to handle
encoded data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">UTF-8 is best for content which is going to be largely ASCII.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">UTF-16 is best for some languages or purposes where the majority of the
characters fits into 2 bytes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">UTF-32 is best for the rest. It is also the fastest to deal with as all
characters takes the same amount of memory so indexing into the data is
clean and obvious, however it takes up 4 times as much space as UTF-8 for
ASCII characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
