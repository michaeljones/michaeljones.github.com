<h2>Weekend</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Worked through chapter 5 and half of chapter 6 of Learn You a Haskell.</li>
<li>Installed ghc-7.6.3 and haskell-platform-2013.2.0.0 using <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/286764/how-to-install-haskell-platform-for-ubuntu-13-04/316465#316465">these</a> instructions
as Ubuntu seems to have made some potentially odd choices for the version of
ghc they shipped on 13.04 so there isn't a packaged haskell-platform available
for it.</li>
<li>Began to look at <a class="reference external" href="http://cppreference.com">cppreference.com</a> to see if there is anything I could
contribution to the community driven project.</li>
<li>Downloaded <a class="reference external" href="http://play0ad.com/">0ad</a> from Ubuntu repositories with the intention of checking it out

<h2>Week in Review</h2>
<p>I had such grand plans moving into this period of personal work. This first week
has been an education in the realities of it all. Mostly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">It is lonely to work from home all day. I am not an enormously social creature
but I certainly miss having colleagues around.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Learning Haskell takes a long time. Coming from imperative programming
languages, it feels like starting again. This is what people say so it
should not have been surprising but I guess I'm not used to feeling
unproductive in a programming environment.</p>
<p>That said, this is the third time I've tried to read through Haskell tutorials
and work through some issues and it is beginning to feel a little more
familiar, a little less alien. Completing basic tasks in the pure functional
side of things is new feeling easy which is a start. IO and more complex
programs still await.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://michaeljones.github.io/blog/posts/2013/10/10/journal-day-4/">previously</a>, the guide I have followed for learning Haskell this
week included more complex problems focussed on simple parts of the language
than I feel I would like. I would rather be learning more about the language
on simpler problems. I feel that if I'm trying to learn a language but
spending significant time trying to understand the actual problem rather than
its solution then I am focussing on the wrongs things.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It is rewarding to engage with people on open source projects. It is fair to
expect certain amount of effort on this part as well. Supporting open source
projects is not customer service as much as guide collaboration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wishlist">
<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More simple problems to tackle in Haskell. I think this is potentially
difficult without introducing IO, but I would argue that it might make sense
to introduce some very basic, even unexplained, IO in order to be able to
tackle some more problems with the rest of the language.</li>
<li>I find myself wanting a Haskell style guide. It is hard to know, as a
beginner, when to use <tt class="docutils literal">where</tt> vs <tt class="docutils literal">let .. in</tt>, when to declare another
independent function vs using <tt class="docutils literal">where</tt>, etc., and how many function calls can
be put in a row before it is deemed unreadable and other mechanisms, like local
bindings, should be introduced to improve readability.</li>
<li>More talks on basic Haskell and introductions to the language. Simon
Peyton-Jones' talks were great but initial googling is no uncovering any more.</li>
</ul>
