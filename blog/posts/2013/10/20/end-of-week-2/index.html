<h2>Weekend</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Decided to start looking at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty">Vty</a> module for Haskell based on the
half-remembered fact that the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/yi-editor/yi">Yi text editor</a> uses it for its terminal
front end.</li>
<li>Talked through my changes to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Everzen/RigControls">RigControls</a> with my brother.</li>
<li>Found a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/All_About_Monads">monad tutorial</a> on the Haskell wiki.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="week-in-review">
<h2>Week in Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">My attitude towards learning Haskell has shifted as I begin to understand a
little of its scope. Initial frustration at the helplessness I felt at not
being able to get anything done has been replaced with an understanding that
Haskell is not trivial to dive into and a little patience goes a long way.</p>
<p>In particular the Learn You a Haskell guide feels particularly brilliantly
laid out and paced. The concepts are built up gradually in a very manageable
way and, whilst I am finding it hard to think of interesting programs to write
with the knowledge I have, there is a definite sense of progress which is
enough to keep the enthusiasm going.</p>
<p>That said, my attempt at the weekend to pick up and write even the most basic
program using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty">Vty</a> module was an education in the different between theory
and practice. It is one thing to read a guide book and quite another to find
your way. Still, a little foolish googling and a few stackoverflow questions
later and I am starting to see a little clearer.</p>
<p>A key issue was that the Vty module does not come with how-to style
documentation [1] and going from the careful breaks downs of the Learn You a
Haskell guide to the currently-still-alien pages of the library documentation
on Haddock was a rather large step. Concepts that I had read about were now
being presented with unfamiliar content and without the careful reminders
needed to take it all on board. Still, progress was made, even if in the most
basic sense and I am a little better equipped than before.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Getting into the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Everzen/RigControls">RigControls</a> project is still primarily reminding me how
little indepth experience I have with Qt. It is also curious to dive into an
existing code base with the intention of cleaning it up some what. Nice to
have the permission but a fresh lesson in how difficult it can be to tackle a
new and relatively undocumented code base.</p>
<p>Possible refactoring would be aided by have test cases but I still have
trouble understanding how to best tackle those in a GUI application.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Whilst I am curious to attempt to contribute to a large project like Libre
Office, or perhaps 0ad, I am finding it a little daunting and easily telling
myself that there is no rush with other commitments at the moment. I think
that it fair. I'd be a fool to take on too much and fail to make significant
progress in any direction.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Supporting incoming user requests on Breathe continues to be of interest. It
feels productive to keep pushing it forward a little and to try to keep
updates clean and useful. I still lack the motivation to take a crack at some
larger issues and reports whilst I have other things to focus on but I am
tempted to at least start working through the back log a little rather than
only picking up new tickets.</p>
